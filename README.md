# Yesteryears Rewound

This is a mod I made just for myself at first, so I had some kind of goal in the game instead of just wandering around near end-game. Then I realized it might be pretty fun for other people too!

The whole premise of the mod is just to gather as many plutonium fuel cells as possible and then "harness" them at once for flux energy that you can use to time travel. You win when you can go back 40 years in time (plus the amount of time in game, after the cataclysm).

To play the mod add it to your world and choose the "Yesteryears Rewound" scenario which will start you off with the time machine, if you want to learn how to operate the machine you could either watch my demonstration of it on YouTube or read onwards for a guide, as comprehensively as I can write at least.

## Installation

Throw that "Yesteryears_Rewound" folder inside your mods, or use your launcher. And you'll be good to go!

## Using the mod

When you start with the scenario you should immediately find the time machine. With the car on an azimuth of 0 degrees, on the driver's seat you can interact with the time circuits and the flux capacitor. In the back of the car is where the engine is located, on the square to the left of the engine you'll find the plutonium chamber. In order to use these tools just 'e'xamine the tile and use the tool.

The time circuits, they're what you use to set the destination. You have a lever that you can pull back in order to go to the past or push forwards to go to the future. You can enter days, hours, minutes or seconds as precisely as you'd like using the keypad UI and confirm it. The time is additive, meaning whatever you enter will be added to the current duration. If you don't want that to happen then just clear the keypad using the '-' key in the menu and re-enter. Make sure to read the screen to see the duration and engage the lever before confirming if you intend to time travel.

The flux capacitor, this is just used as the final check before initiating the time travel, also you can check the available flux energy for time travel here.

The plutonium chamber, this actually has a "sticky note" that you can read for more exact info, but this is where you insert or take out plutonium fuel cells, the more you have at once the more flux energy they'll give you, 1 gives you 1 month but 42 will give you 40 years and half a year or so. The actual mathematical formula for it is shown in game on the sticky note.
